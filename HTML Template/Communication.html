        <p>Here's how I like to communicate...</p>

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Teams/Slack</span></h2>
        <p>Our team uses both Teams and Slack:
        <p>We use Team and its video-conferencing features for all of our scheduled meetings. This includes meetings with stakeholders and people outside of the tech team.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Slack is used for quick conversation or questions. We use slack huddles if someone is struggling with some code and needs a quick second opinion. Slack is mostly used by the tech team in our area of the business.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Email</span></h2>
        <p>Email is important for more formal messages:
            <p>I use email when sending off reports, or when messaging people outside of the electric vehicle charging team, 
                <p>It is also handy when I want a thread of messages with a person which is useful if a problem or query cannot be resolved or answered immediately.</p>
            </p>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Video Call</span></h2>
        <p>We video call via Teams or Slack:</p>
        <p>Teams is preferred for scheduled meetings such as stand-ups or meetings with stakeholders. They can be easily scheduled and changed.</p>
        <p>Slack is preferred for impromptu meetings or meetings that won't take too long. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Face-to-Face</span></h2>
        <p>We rarely utilise in-person meetings, but they are very useful:</p>
        <p>Face-to-face communication is preferred when the whole team, not just the developers, need to get together to discuss plans for the next quarter.
        <p>This style of communication is also good for team events such as hackathons and can boost team morale!</p>
