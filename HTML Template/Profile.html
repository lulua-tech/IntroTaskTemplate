        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Languages student turned developer:</p>
        <p>I studied Arabic with French at university, living abroad in the Middle East for a year.</p>
        <p>My interest in coding began when I was 10, when I made my first website using HTML and CSS at a Saturday school for kids interested in IT. </p>
        <p>After university, I did a bootcamp in Full-Stack Development. I really enjoy the blend of STEM and Humanities  that coding provides!</p>
