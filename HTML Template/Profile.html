        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Languages student turned developer:</p>
        <p>I studied Arabic with French at university, living abroad in the Middle East for a year.</p>
        <p>My interest in coding began when I was 10, when I made my first website using HTML and CSS at a Saturday school for kids interested in IT. </p>
        <p>After university, I did a bootcamp in Full-Stack Development. I really enjoy the blend of STEM and Humanities  that coding provides!</p>

        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>Here's how I like to work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to be contacted via Teams or Slack. I especially like in-person communication!</li>
            <li>I enjoy working independently the most and like having structured tasks to complete.</li>
            <li>Respecting deadlines is important to me.</li>
            <li>I'm always open to constructive feedback. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Past Experience and CPD</h2>
        <p>Before my current role...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Previous Roles:</strong> I came to software engineering straight from university but worked a number of part-time jobs alongside my studies. These included bar work, retail and a social media marketing internship.</li>
            <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Made a hobby generator to get more people outdoors with my bootcamp team. It had a working frontend and backend, and a mock-login and accounts area. I am currently working on a dinosaur desktop app in which you can hatch an egg to receive a random digital dinosaur buddy.</li>
            <li><strong>Training:</strong> I enjoy following coding tutorials on YouTube and watching how my colleagues solve problems. I am very interested in making software more accessible at the moment, and so have been watching many videos on UX fundamentals and reading books on human-computer interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning languages</strong> - I am currently trying to (re)learn Farsi which I studied for a year at university. </li>
            <li><strong>Keeping Fit</strong> - I am a frequent gym-goer and enjoy lifting weights. I also enjoy a run from time to time.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming</strong> - Specifically cozy Nintendo games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. I was also Minecraft-obsessed as a child, but currently don't have a PC powerful enough to run it smoothly!</li>
            <li><strong>Music</strong> - I play the piano and attend a local choir. I also recently got a Kalimba. Look it up. It's nice!</li>
            <li><strong>Reading</strong> - I try and read whenever I have some free time. I've really been enjoying non-fiction books at the moment.</li>
        </ul>
