        <h1 class="intro-title">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. Explain the stages of the SDLC below, in detail:
        </p>

    <div class="boxes-two-columns">
    <section class="box">
        <h2>
            <span class="stage-title"">Planning</span>
        </h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/thought-logo.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="Thought Bubble Icon">This stage involves defining the software's scope and purpose. It looks at what the application should do based on business requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The team needs to understand the user's needs and so a feasability study will often take place. This is where the team evaluates the technical and financial challenges of the project. </p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The team will produce a project plan, which includes the scope, resources, and timeline for the project. A software requirement specification (SRS) may also be created which details the software's function and resources, alongside possible risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Product managers/owners and people in business-facing roles such as business analysts and other stakeholders help to assess the business case for the project. Software engineers and other members of the tech team help to assess its technical feasability and can help to identify potential risks.  </p>
   
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Requirements</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/list-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="To-Do List Icon">This stage identifies, documents and analyses the needs of stakeholders to decide what the application should do, outlining the problems to be solved and how it should function.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The team will gather requirements from stakeholders, which may include users, customers, and business analysts. This can involve interviews, surveys, and workshops.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> After analysing the data, the team will create a requirements specification document which outlines the application's purpose and functionalities and may include cost estimates.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Similar to the planning stage, business stakeholders such as business clients or users will decide the business case whilst product managers will relay this information to the engineers. The developers will then help with deciding its feasability from a tech perspective. .</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Design</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/design-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="Paintbrush Icon">The design stage builds the framework for the project, outlining its functionality and interface. It considers navigation, user experience and database design among others.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The requirements specification document from the previous stage is used to guide the design process. The team will also consider technical constraints and user experience. This can include the creation of data flow diagrams or user interface mock-ups. System dependencies and possible integrations are also identified.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The result is a software design document (SDD) which details the roadmap for the application. It details its design, from system architecture to databases, all the way to user interface specifics.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Software architects, UI/UX designers, and developers collaborate to create the design. They ensure that the design meets both functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Development</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/dev-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="HTML Tag Icon">The project is finally underway, and developers are working to turn the idea into tangible code.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The design document from the previous stage serves as a blueprint for development while regular code reviews help team members to look for any bugs or inconsistencies. The code may also be tested to check it functions as it should.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The result of this stage is the software itself which should now be useable, though might not be perfect just yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Developers, software engineers, and quality assurance (QA) testers are the primary contributors. They write code, perform unit tests, and ensure that the software meets the design specifications. Product owners/managers also work to keep the tech team on track, reminding them of any requirements for the application or keeping them updated with any changes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Testing</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/test-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="Test Tube Icon">The testing stage is essential to identify any weaknesses in the application or bugs which may have been missed during development.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The application is tested against the requirements and design specifications and a series of test cases are created. This can include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests (UAT). If a bug is found, it is detailed and sent back to developers to fix it.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Once bugs are sent back to developers and fixed, the application is put through another round of testing and refinement, until the tested application that meets the requirements is ready for deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> QA testers, developers, and product owners are involved in this stage. They work together to ensure that the software is functional, reliable, and meets the specified requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Deployment</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/rocket-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="Rocket Icon">The deployment stage is perhaps the most exciting stage of the cycle. This is where the product is released to users.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The final tested application is prepared for deployment. This can include packaging the software, configuring servers, and setting up databases. It can then be moved from its development/testing environment to production, exposing the application to users. This software might be rolled out gradually using region-based deployments or feature flags to ensure it is working well before releasing to everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The application is live but will be continually worked on in order to fix bugs or simply to improve it.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers are typically involved in the deployment process. They ensure that the software is installed correctly and is functioning as expected in the production environment. Other members of the business, such as product owners or business analysts may look to see how users are reacting to the software and may flag any issues they are having. </p>

    <section class="box">
        <h2><span class="stage-title">Maintenance</span></h2>
        <p><img src="Images/SDLCImages/tool-icon.png" class="sdlc-icon" alt="Tools Icon">The final phase of the SDLC, maintenance is essential for when users find bugs or issues. It may also look at the success of the software, looking at user engagement and interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> User feedback, bug reports, and performance metrics are collected to identify areas for improvement. This can include monitoring the software's performance and user satisfaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The team will release updates, patches, and enhancements to the software. This can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features based on user feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Developers, product managers and other team members such as business analysts are involved in the maintenance phase. Developers help to fix bugs, continuously improving and patching the software while more comercially-minded team members work to ensure the software is still serving its initial function and attracting users or customers. </p>
